# flask-task-manager
A simple Task Manager website in Flask

This is my first project with Flask but defenitely not the last one! I treat it mainly as a reference/starting point for the next projects.

## INSTALL

If you want to try it yourself just run:
1. `git clone https://github.com/msztylko/flask-task-manager.git && cd flask-task-manager`
2. `docker build -t flask-task-manager .`  
3. `docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-task-manager`
4. In your browser go to `localhost:5000`
